# Julia-Perceptron
The perceptron is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is able to operate as a boolean function on linearly separable data.
The algorithm was developed in the late 1950's by neurobiology professor Frank Rosenblatt of Cornell University. 
The perceptron is often referred to as an artificial neuron due to it functioning similarly to natural neurons from the brain.
This project demonstrates the building, training and use of a perceptron as an AND/OR logic gate.
Logic gates are boolean functions that take in one or more inputs and produce an output of either true or false.
